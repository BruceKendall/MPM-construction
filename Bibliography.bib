abstract = {Population stage structure is fundamental to ecology, and models of this structure have proven useful in many different systems. Many ecological variables other than stage, such as habitat type, site occupancy and metapopulation status are also modelled using transitions among discrete states. Transitions among life stages can be characterised by the distribution of time spent in each stage, including the mean and variance of each stage duration and within-individual correlations among multiple stage durations. Three modelling traditions represent stage durations differently. Matrix models can be derived as a long-run approximation from any distribution of stage durations, but they are often interpreted directly as a Markov model for stage transitions. Statistical stage-duration distribution models accommodate the variation typical of cohort development data, but such realism has rarely been incorporated in population theory or statistical population models. Delay-differential equation models include lags but no variation, except in limited cases. We synthesise these models in one framework and illustrate how individual variation and correlations in development can impact population growth. Furthermore, different development models can yield the same long-term matrix transition rates but different sensitivities and elasticities. Finally, we discuss future directions for estimating realistic stage duration models from data.},

abstract = {Abstract: While the wealth of projection matrices in plant demography permits comparative studies, variation in matrix dimensions complicates interspecific comparisons. Collapsing matrices to a common dimension may facilitate such comparisons but may also bias the inferred demographic parameters. Here we examine how matrix dimension affects inferred demographic elasticities and how different collapsing criteria perform. We analyzed [Formula: see text] matrices representing nine plant species, collapsing these matrices (i) into even [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] matrices and (ii) into [Formula: see text] matrices using different criteria. Stasis and fecundity elasticities increased when matrix dimension was reduced, whereas those of progression and retrogression decreased. We suggest a collapsing criterion that minimizes dissimilarities between the original- and collapsed-matrix elasticities and apply it to 66 plant species to study how life span and growth form influence the relationship between matrix dimension and elasticities. Our analysis demonstrates that (i) projection matrix dimension has significant effects on inferred demographic parameters, (ii) there are better-performing methods than previously suggested for standardizing matrix dimension, and (iii) herbaceous perennial projection matrices are particularly sensitive to changes in matrix dimensionality. For comparative demographic studies, we recommend normalizing matrices to a common dimension by collapsing higher classes and leaving the first few classes unaltered.},

It is written by a leading research team in this area and includes code in the R language (in the text and online) to carry out all computations. The intended audience are ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and mathematical biologists interested in developing data-driven models for animal and plant populations. IPMs may seem hard as they involve integrals. The aim of this book is to demystify IPMs, so they become the model of choice for populations structured by size or other continuously varying traits. The book uses real examples of increasing complexity to show how the life-cycle of the study organism naturally leads to the appropriate statistical analysis, which leads directly to the IPM itself. A wide range of model types and analyses are presented, including model construction, computational methods, and the underlying theory, with the more technical material in Boxes and Appendices. Self-contained R code which replicates all of the figures and calculations within the text is available to readers on GitHub. Stephen P. Ellner is Horace White Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University, USA; Dylan Z.

year = {2016}, 
abstract = {The open-data scientific philosophy is being widely adopted and proving to promote considerable progress in ecology and evolution. Open-data global data bases now exist on animal migration, species distribution, conservation status, etc. However, a gap exists for data on population dynamics spanning the rich diversity of the animal kingdom world-wide. This information is fundamental to our understanding of the conditions that have shaped variation in animal life histories and their relationships with the environment, as well as the determinants of invasion and extinction. Matrix population models (MPMs) are among the most widely used demographic tools by animal ecologists. MPMs project population dynamics based on the reproduction, survival and development of individuals in a population over their life cycle. The outputs from MPMs have direct biological interpretations, facilitating comparisons among animal species as different as Caenorhabditis elegans, Loxodonta africana and Homo sapiens. Thousands of animal demographic records exist in the form of MPMs, but they are dispersed throughout the literature, rendering comparative analyses difficult. Here, we introduce the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, an open-data online repository, which in its version 1.0.0 contains data on 345 species world-wide, from 402 studies with a total of 1625 population projection matrices. COMADRE also contains ancillary information (e.g. ecoregion, taxonomy, biogeography, etc.) that facilitates interpretation of the numerous demographic metrics that can be derived from its MPMs. We provide R code to some of these examples. SYNTHESIS: We introduce the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, a resource for animal demography. Its open-data nature, together with its ancillary information, will facilitate comparative analysis, as will the growing availability of databases focusing on other aspects of the rich animal diversity, and tools to query and combine them. Through future frequent updates of COMADRE, and its integration with other online resources, we encourage animal ecologists to tackle global ecological and evolutionary questions with unprecedented sample size.},

Plants exhibit a wide range of patterns of longevity, growth, and reproduction, but the general determinants of this enormous variation in life history are poorly understood. We use demographic data from 418 plant species in the wild, from annual herbs to supercentennial trees, to examine how growth form, habitat, and phylogenetic relationships structure plant life histories and to develop a framework to predict population performance. We show that 55\% of the variation in plant life-history strategies is adequately characterized using two independent axes: the fast-slow continuum, including fast-growing, short-lived plant species at one end and slow-growing, long-lived species at the other, and a reproductive strategy axis, with highly reproductive, iteroparous species at one extreme and poorly reproductive, semelparous plants with frequent shrinkage at the other. Our findings remain consistent across major habitats and are minimally affected by plant growth form and phylogenetic ancestry, suggesting that the relative independence of the fast-slow and reproduction strategy axes is general in the plant kingdom. Our findings have similarities with how life-history strategies are structured in mammals, birds, and reptiles. The position of plant species populations in the 2D space produced by both axes predicts their rate of recovery from disturbances and population growth rate. This life-history framework may complement trait-based frameworks on leaf and wood economics; together these frameworks may allow prediction of responses of plants to anthropogenic disturbances and changing environments.},

To better define the characteristics of the northern population, we combined published life‐history and vital rate data for studies conducted in North Carolina and South Carolina; for comparison, we gleaned the same information from the literature for the southern (Florida and Louisiana) population. We constructed a 5‐stage Lefkovitch matrix model for each population. The models showed that the southern population was stable and slightly increasing (λ = 1.02), whereas the northern population was in decline (λ = 0.870). We integrated potential impacts of climate change into the northern population model to determine how the population might respond to increased temperature and decreased precipitation. An increase in temperature would benefit the northern population; however, a decrease in precipitation or the combined effects of temperature increase and precipitation decrease would negatively affect the viability of the northern population. Two priorities result from modeling these scenarios: 1) a long‐term monitoring program is needed to acquire the life‐history and vital rate data on the northern population, and 2) current alligator habitat must be conserved or improved to insulate the species from potential drought associated with climate change.},

However, it is complex and hard to interpret. Here, we present a new approach where the generation time is envisioned as a return time in an appropriate Markov chain. This yields surprisingly simple results, such as the fact that the generation time is the inverse of the sum of the elasticities of the growth rate to changes in the fertilities. This result sheds new light on the interpretation of elasticities (which as we show correspond to the frequency of events in the ancestral lineage of the population), and we use it to generalize a result known as Lebreton’s formula. Finally, we also show that the generation time can be seen as a random variable, and we give a general expression for its distribution.},

According to von Bertallanffy’ method B. fruticum needs 5 years to attain its maximum size in the field of 25.40 mm. Mortality rate increases and life expectancy decreases with increasing age. Net reproductive rate (Ro) was equal to 3. 15 and per capita rate of increase (rc) was equal to 1.

Annual secondary production, calculated by Hynes’ size frequency method, revealed a mean annual density of 5.9 individuals/m2, a mean standing crop (B) of 8.09 g/m2/year and an annual production (P) of 1.92 ± 0.11g/m2/year. Annual turnover ratio (P/B) was equal to 2.37.},

abstract = {A mark-recapture study was carried out in sympatric populations of Lacerta agilis and Lacerta vivipara in the Netherlands from 1976 to 1982. In most years the age structure of both populations was pyramidal. For both species life expectation of females was higher and on average they did live longer. Hence the sex ratio for adults deviated significantly from 1.0 in favour of females. Maximum age for Lacerta vivipara was 8 years (female) and for Lacerta agilis 12 years (male). The density of both species fluctuated around 100/ha. The biomass of Lacerta agilis was twice that of Lacerta vivipara. In Lacerta vivipara the 3rd and 4th calendar year class supplied 78\% of total net reproduction; in Lacerta agilis the 4th, 5th, and 6th calendar year classes supplied 68\%. In both populations the population replacement rate was 2. Population turnover time was 4.83 years for Lacerta agilis and 2.81 for Lacerta vivipara. The life history strategy of the Lacerta vivipara population is compared with six other European Lacerta vivipara populations.},
