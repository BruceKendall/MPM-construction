abstract = {Population stage structure is fundamental to ecology, and models of this structure have proven useful in many different systems. Many ecological variables other than stage, such as habitat type, site occupancy and metapopulation status are also modelled using transitions among discrete states. Transitions among life stages can be characterised by the distribution of time spent in each stage, including the mean and variance of each stage duration and within-individual correlations among multiple stage durations. Three modelling traditions represent stage durations differently. Matrix models can be derived as a long-run approximation from any distribution of stage durations, but they are often interpreted directly as a Markov model for stage transitions. Statistical stage-duration distribution models accommodate the variation typical of cohort development data, but such realism has rarely been incorporated in population theory or statistical population models. Delay-differential equation models include lags but no variation, except in limited cases. We synthesise these models in one framework and illustrate how individual variation and correlations in development can impact population growth. Furthermore, different development models can yield the same long-term matrix transition rates but different sensitivities and elasticities. Finally, we discuss future directions for estimating realistic stage duration models from data.},

abstract = {Abstract: While the wealth of projection matrices in plant demography permits comparative studies, variation in matrix dimensions complicates interspecific comparisons. Collapsing matrices to a common dimension may facilitate such comparisons but may also bias the inferred demographic parameters. Here we examine how matrix dimension affects inferred demographic elasticities and how different collapsing criteria perform. We analyzed [Formula: see text] matrices representing nine plant species, collapsing these matrices (i) into even [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], [Formula: see text], and [Formula: see text] matrices and (ii) into [Formula: see text] matrices using different criteria. Stasis and fecundity elasticities increased when matrix dimension was reduced, whereas those of progression and retrogression decreased. We suggest a collapsing criterion that minimizes dissimilarities between the original- and collapsed-matrix elasticities and apply it to 66 plant species to study how life span and growth form influence the relationship between matrix dimension and elasticities. Our analysis demonstrates that (i) projection matrix dimension has significant effects on inferred demographic parameters, (ii) there are better-performing methods than previously suggested for standardizing matrix dimension, and (iii) herbaceous perennial projection matrices are particularly sensitive to changes in matrix dimensionality. For comparative demographic studies, we recommend normalizing matrices to a common dimension by collapsing higher classes and leaving the first few classes unaltered.},

It is written by a leading research team in this area and includes code in the R language (in the text and online) to carry out all computations. The intended audience are ecologists, evolutionary biologists, and mathematical biologists interested in developing data-driven models for animal and plant populations. IPMs may seem hard as they involve integrals. The aim of this book is to demystify IPMs, so they become the model of choice for populations structured by size or other continuously varying traits. The book uses real examples of increasing complexity to show how the life-cycle of the study organism naturally leads to the appropriate statistical analysis, which leads directly to the IPM itself. A wide range of model types and analyses are presented, including model construction, computational methods, and the underlying theory, with the more technical material in Boxes and Appendices. Self-contained R code which replicates all of the figures and calculations within the text is available to readers on GitHub. Stephen P. Ellner is Horace White Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at Cornell University, USA; Dylan Z.

year = {2016}, 
abstract = {The open-data scientific philosophy is being widely adopted and proving to promote considerable progress in ecology and evolution. Open-data global data bases now exist on animal migration, species distribution, conservation status, etc. However, a gap exists for data on population dynamics spanning the rich diversity of the animal kingdom world-wide. This information is fundamental to our understanding of the conditions that have shaped variation in animal life histories and their relationships with the environment, as well as the determinants of invasion and extinction. Matrix population models (MPMs) are among the most widely used demographic tools by animal ecologists. MPMs project population dynamics based on the reproduction, survival and development of individuals in a population over their life cycle. The outputs from MPMs have direct biological interpretations, facilitating comparisons among animal species as different as Caenorhabditis elegans, Loxodonta africana and Homo sapiens. Thousands of animal demographic records exist in the form of MPMs, but they are dispersed throughout the literature, rendering comparative analyses difficult. Here, we introduce the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, an open-data online repository, which in its version 1.0.0 contains data on 345 species world-wide, from 402 studies with a total of 1625 population projection matrices. COMADRE also contains ancillary information (e.g. ecoregion, taxonomy, biogeography, etc.) that facilitates interpretation of the numerous demographic metrics that can be derived from its MPMs. We provide R code to some of these examples. SYNTHESIS: We introduce the COMADRE Animal Matrix Database, a resource for animal demography. Its open-data nature, together with its ancillary information, will facilitate comparative analysis, as will the growing availability of databases focusing on other aspects of the rich animal diversity, and tools to query and combine them. Through future frequent updates of COMADRE, and its integration with other online resources, we encourage animal ecologists to tackle global ecological and evolutionary questions with unprecedented sample size.},

Plants exhibit a wide range of patterns of longevity, growth, and reproduction, but the general determinants of this enormous variation in life history are poorly understood. We use demographic data from 418 plant species in the wild, from annual herbs to supercentennial trees, to examine how growth form, habitat, and phylogenetic relationships structure plant life histories and to develop a framework to predict population performance. We show that 55\% of the variation in plant life-history strategies is adequately characterized using two independent axes: the fast-slow continuum, including fast-growing, short-lived plant species at one end and slow-growing, long-lived species at the other, and a reproductive strategy axis, with highly reproductive, iteroparous species at one extreme and poorly reproductive, semelparous plants with frequent shrinkage at the other. Our findings remain consistent across major habitats and are minimally affected by plant growth form and phylogenetic ancestry, suggesting that the relative independence of the fast-slow and reproduction strategy axes is general in the plant kingdom. Our findings have similarities with how life-history strategies are structured in mammals, birds, and reptiles. The position of plant species populations in the 2D space produced by both axes predicts their rate of recovery from disturbances and population growth rate. This life-history framework may complement trait-based frameworks on leaf and wood economics; together these frameworks may allow prediction of responses of plants to anthropogenic disturbances and changing environments.},

To better define the characteristics of the northern population, we combined published life‐history and vital rate data for studies conducted in North Carolina and South Carolina; for comparison, we gleaned the same information from the literature for the southern (Florida and Louisiana) population. We constructed a 5‐stage Lefkovitch matrix model for each population. The models showed that the southern population was stable and slightly increasing (λ = 1.02), whereas the northern population was in decline (λ = 0.870). We integrated potential impacts of climate change into the northern population model to determine how the population might respond to increased temperature and decreased precipitation. An increase in temperature would benefit the northern population; however, a decrease in precipitation or the combined effects of temperature increase and precipitation decrease would negatively affect the viability of the northern population. Two priorities result from modeling these scenarios: 1) a long‐term monitoring program is needed to acquire the life‐history and vital rate data on the northern population, and 2) current alligator habitat must be conserved or improved to insulate the species from potential drought associated with climate change.},

This yields surprisingly simple results, such as the fact that the generation time is the inverse of the sum of the elasticities of the growth rate to changes in the fertilities. This result sheds new light on the interpretation of elasticities (which as we show correspond to the frequency of events in the ancestral lineage of the population), and we use it to generalize a result known as Lebreton’s formula. Finally, we also show that the generation time can be seen as a random variable, and we give a general expression for its distribution.},

Annual secondary production, calculated by Hynes’ size frequency method, revealed a mean annual density of 5.9 individuals/m2, a mean standing crop (B) of 8.09 g/m2/year and an annual production (P) of 1.92 ± 0.11g/m2/year. Annual turnover ratio (P/B) was equal to 2.37.},

abstract = {A mark-recapture study was carried out in sympatric populations of Lacerta agilis and Lacerta vivipara in the Netherlands from 1976 to 1982. In most years the age structure of both populations was pyramidal. For both species life expectation of females was higher and on average they did live longer. Hence the sex ratio for adults deviated significantly from 1.0 in favour of females. Maximum age for Lacerta vivipara was 8 years (female) and for Lacerta agilis 12 years (male). The density of both species fluctuated around 100/ha. The biomass of Lacerta agilis was twice that of Lacerta vivipara. In Lacerta vivipara the 3rd and 4th calendar year class supplied 78\% of total net reproduction; in Lacerta agilis the 4th, 5th, and 6th calendar year classes supplied 68\%. In both populations the population replacement rate was 2. Population turnover time was 4.83 years for Lacerta agilis and 2.81 for Lacerta vivipara. The life history strategy of the Lacerta vivipara population is compared with six other European Lacerta vivipara populations.},

journal = {Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales}, 
volume = {115},

year = {1995}, 
abstract = {The mangrove shrub Aegiceras corniculatum (L.) Blanco commonly occurs in estuaries north from Merrimbula in southern NSW. Studies of the population dynamics were undertaken atJervis Bay as part of wider baseline studies of the marine environment of the Bay. Populations in Jervis Bay flowered regularly during spring and prodnced viviparous fruit by the following autumn. Predispersal mortality of fruits was very high (92 \%), but exclusion of herbivores reduced mortality to 53\%. About 360 viable propagules were produced per plant each year, representing some 32\% of above-ground productivity. Once dispersed propagules can remain bouyant in seawater for up to three months, but under brackish conditions sink within a week and do not refloat. During the dispersal phase, propagules landing on intertidal sediments had a low probability of establishing because of predators and tidal disturbance. Establishment, however, appeared to be in- trinsically slow because of the season in which propagules are dispersed. Shadehouse experiments also showed that propagules establish more rapidly in 10\% and 50\% seawater than in full seawater.
Adult populations ofAeg~ceras corniculatumwere conspicuously zoned in relation to the co-occurring mangrove Avicennia marina (Forsk.) Vierh. The former usually occurred at the higher edge of the mangrove zone in the marine zone of the estuary, whereas popu- lations in the riverine zone of the estuary dominated the lower edge of the mangrove zone.
Establishment and recruitment appear to be episodic and highly patchy in space, although without an unambiguous measure of the age structure it is difficult to infer any population trends. Evidence from aerial photography suggests that the spatial extent of populations of A. corniculatum has remained static over the past 50 years, while that of Avicennia marina has spread. Based on broad regeneration syndromes, I predict that Avicennia marinawould replace Aegiceras corniculaturn under conditions of disturbance, but under long-term stable conditions the converse would apply.},

Zygote survival, propagule dispersal, seedling establishment, seedling recruitment and sapling recruitment were examined by demographic censuses over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Hypotheses about factors regulating survival were tested by manipulative field experiments. Life table statistics for survival and fecundity were used to calculate transition probabilities and their variance for seven stages of life history. These parameters were used as the basis of a stochastic model that predicts population structure after small and large scale perturbations.},

journal = {Ecological Monographs}, 
volume = {65}, 
pages = {155-192}, 
year = {1995}, 
abstract = {Our goal was to elucidate the population dynamics of the perennial understory herb Calathea ovandensis in a rain forest in southern Mexico using matrix projection model analysis. We emphasize the magnitude and consequences of spatiotemporal variation in (1) basic demographic parameters (growth, survival, and reproduction) (2) asymptotic demographic properties of a given environment (the asymptotic population growth rate and the associated stable---stage distribution and reproductive values) and (3) demographic sensitivities associated with a given environment (sensitivity and elasticity). We obtained 6 yr (1982---1987) of empirical data from four study plots (differing in substrate, light, and density) from which we used the first 5 yr (1982---1986) to construct 16 plot---year and 1 pooled population projection matrices. This stage---structured population was characterized by a long---lived seed bank, temporally variable seedling recruitment (10---fold variability among years), high mortality of seedlings (>90\%), very low mortality of reproductives (usually <10\%), fertility that increased markedly with plant size, and the ability of large plants to shrink rather than die under adversity. Within these broad outlines, the magnitudes of transitions representing demographic fates exhibited considerable variation through space and time, some parameters varying much more than others (CV from 22 to 400\%). Growth and reproduction were positively correlated across environments. The least variable parameters were seed dormancy and stasis of small reproductives. Observed stage distributions were reasonably close to the stable stage distributions (mean = 86.1\% similar). In most plot---years, the stable---stage distribution was dominated by seeds, followed by seedlings, and then small reproductives and the reproductive values increased with size class. Population growth rates, given by the dominant eigenvalue of the matrices, ranged from 0.73 to 1.25. Analysis of the mean dynamics gave λ = 0.97 (using a variety of analytical approaches) and our analysis of the overall pooled dynamics gave a λ = 0.99, indicating that the habitat at the study site favored the persistence of Calathea ovandensis. An el Nino even coincided with the year of the highest population growth rate. Survival, growth, and reproduction varied significantly through space and time, and different plot---years were beneficial to different stages. Most interestingly, stage---specific sensitivity parameters (sensitivity and elasticity) also varied through space and time. Spatiotemporal variability of sensitivity structure has important implications. Determination of stages most “critical” to population dynamics will depend upon knowledge of this variation. Population growth rate was significantly positively correlated with elasticity of seed production, seed germination, and seedling growth. These results indicate that the opportunity for selection on plant characters affecting particular life history stages varies through space and time even if the effect on the single---stage transition probability does not vary. Selection on characters affecting juvenile stages may be stronger in populations of higher growth rates.},

abstract = {Abstract: Inventory, monitoring, and experimental studies have been the primary approaches for documenting and understanding the problem of amphibian declines. However, little attention has been given to placing human‐caused perturbations affecting one or more life‐history stages in the context of the overall population dynamics of particular species. We used two types of ecological sensitivity analysis to determine which vital rates have the strongest influence on the population dynamics of western toads (   Bufo boreas), red‐legged frogs (  Rana aurora), and common frogs (  Rana temporaria), pond‐breeding amphibians that have declined in all or portions of their ranges. Our results suggest that post‐metamorphic vital rates and highly variable vital rates both have a strong influence on the population dynamics of these species and therefore deserve more research and management attention. Ecological sensitivity analysis should be more widely applied to the issue of amphibian declines in order to identify the most plausible mechanisms of decline and prioritize which life‐history stages should be the focus of research and management efforts. Future experimental studies of perturbations in one or more life‐history stage should attempt to link the magnitude of the perturbation measured with the overall population‐level consequences. Finally, current research, inventory, and monitoring efforts should be supplemented with demographic studies so that quantitative analyses can be applied to a wider range of species and life‐history groups.},
