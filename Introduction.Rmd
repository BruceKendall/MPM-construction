## Mathematical essentials
There is no getting around the fact that MPMs are mathematical constructs.
However, I will try to make the notation be as closely tied to the biology as possible. 
One challenge is that we nned a consistent way to reference demographic rates of specific age, size, or stage classes.
In *mathematical* notation, $p_i$ is the survival rate of individuals in the $i$'th class.
Thus, for example, in an age-structured model with age classes 0, 1, 2, and so on, $p_2$ is the survival of one-year-olds.
In a stage-structured model with stage classes newborn, juvenile, sub-adult and adult, then $p_2$ is the survival of juveniles.
Keeping track of this mapping requires extra cognitive work, and can be especially confusing in age-structured models where the mathematical index and the biological age don't align.^[One could, of course, start the mathematical index at zero, and you will see this in some textbooks; but this leads to inconsistencies betwewn age-structured and other models. It also doesn't work in R, where the indexing of a vector always starts at one.]
Thus I introduce a *biological* notation, in which the actual age or the name of the class is shown between parentheses in the subscript.
Thus, in an age-structured model, $p_{(2)}$ is the survival of two-year-olds (survival from age 2 to age 3).
In a stage-structured model, $p_{(\text{sub-adult})}$ is the annual survival of individuals who start the year in the sub-adult stage.

This distinction is also useful in referencing the vector of population abundances in year $t$, $\vect{n}(t)$. 
As we will see, MPMs can be constructed in different ways that either do or do not include newborn individuals in the population vector.
In that case, careful attention to context is required to know what $n_1(t)$ (the first element of $\vect{n}(t)$) refers to.
In contrast, $n_{(0)}(t)$ vs. $n_{(1)}(t)$, or $n_{(\text{newborn})}(t)$ vs. $n_{(\text{juvenile})}(t)$, is clear and unambiguous.
