Kendall 2019-09-11 Preface Matrix population models are powerful tools for quantitatively integrating demographic and life history information to address ecological questions as well as prioritizing management for rare, harvested, or invasive species. The growth of empirical MPMs Getting MPMs just right can be tricky if one is not used to “thinking like a modeller.” Lots of published MPMs have errors (Kendall et al. 2019) The audience for this book is ecologists and conservation biologists whose focus is primarily empirical: you are used to collecting data and analyzing it statistically, but you are not well-versed in constructing and analyzing mathematical models. The first goal of this book is to provide a gentle tutorial, and introduce a new approach to MPM construction that keeps you, the biolgist, focused on events in the life cycle of your organism, and uses the computer to integrate all the pieces into the model. I start with the classic age-, size-, and stage-structured MPMs. This approach is then expanded to incorporate richer biological detail into the model, such as extended pregnancy or periods when the offspring is dependent on its parents for survival.
