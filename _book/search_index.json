Kendall 2019-09-12 Preface Matrix population models are powerful tools for quantitatively integrating demographic and life history information to address ecological questions as well as prioritizing management for rare, harvested, or invasive species. The growth of empirical MPMs Getting MPMs just right can be tricky if one is not used to “thinking like a modeller.” Lots of published MPMs have errors (Kendall et al. 2019) The audience for this book is ecologists and conservation biologists whose focus is primarily empirical: you are used to collecting data and analyzing it statistically, but you are not well-versed in constructing and analyzing mathematical models. The first goal of this book is to provide a gentle tutorial, and introduce a new approach to MPM construction that keeps you, the biolgist, focused on events in the life cycle of your organism, and uses the computer to integrate all the pieces into the model. I start with the classic age-, size-, and stage-structured MPMs. This approach is then expanded to incorporate richer biological detail into the model, such as extended pregnancy or periods when the offspring is dependent on its parents for survival.

Ideally, this will be survival from one birthay to the next (including from birth to the first birthday). If males and females have different survival rates, list the female values. We will call this list the vector \\(\\mathbf{p}\\), with elements \\(p_0\\), \\(p_1\\), \\(p_2\\), etc. A list of age-specific birth rates: For each parental age, the number of offspring per parent (counting both parents), or the number of female offspring produced by each female parent. We will call this list the vector \\(\\mathbf{b}\\), with elements \\(b_1\\), \\(b_2\\), etc. Newborns cannot reproduce, so there is no value of \\(b_0\\); if the age at first reproduction is less than one, then you will need a shorter timestep. Identify the maximum age, above which there is no survival. Call this age \\(m\\); while there may be a non-zero birth rate \\(b_m\\), \\(m\\)-year-olds do not survive to age \\(m+1\\), so \\(p_m = 0\\). When these are arranged in tabular form, it will look like part of a life table, which you may recall from undergraduate ecology courses. In fact, these two lists provide all the information needed to construct the other columns of the life table; but we don’t need those to construct an MPM, so don’t pursue that further. Table 3.1: Age-specific survival and birth rates for the land snail Fruticicola fruticum (Bradybaenidae) (Staicou et al. 1990) Age in years (\\(x\\)) Annual survival (\\(p_x\\)) Female offpring per female (\\(b_x\\)) 0 0.8190 NA 1 0.5165 0.00 2 0.2648 16.69 3 0.0536 6.00 4 0.1667 0.00 5 NA 0.00 3.1.2 Construct the birth matrix, \\(\\mathbf{B}\\) Make an \\(m \\times m\\) identity matrix (with ones on the diagonal, and zeros everywhere else) Add an extra row on top, with the birth rates If \\(m=3\\), this would look like: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{B} = \\begin{pmatrix} b_1 &amp; b_2 &amp; b_3 \\\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\end{pmatrix} \\end{equation}\\] 3.1.3 Construct the survival matrix, \\(\\mathbf{P}\\) Make an \\(m \\times m\\) matrix with the survival values on the diagonal, and zeros everywhere else Add an extra column of zeros on the right If \\(m=3\\), this would look like: \\[\\begin{equation} \\mathbf{P} = \\begin{pmatrix} p_0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; p_1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; p_2 &amp; 0 \\end{pmatrix} \\end{equation}\\] "],
